# Poddley - Search podcasts like text
## Frontend:
- Nuxt 3 for client-stuff
- [JSON to TypeScript type for types generation based on API response](https://transform.tools/json-to-typescript)
- Pinia for store
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS for UI adjustments
- Bootstrap + Bootstrap Studio for responsive layout as it provides good UI for modifying design
- Netlify.com for CI/CD of Client code + using them as a DNS-manager for easier setup.
- Tracking is done by Plausible

## Backend:
### API:
- Route-Controller-Service structure for ExpressJS/Node-backends. [Rundown here](https://devtut.github.io/nodejs/route-controller-service-structure-for-expressjs.html#model-routes-controllers-services-code-structure)
- Written in TypeScript

### Full-text searching
- Automatic indexing of meilisearch indexes based on new data in MySQL database is done using a cron-job that pushes into the meilisearch indexes.
- Runs as an eGPU on a local computer running an RTX 1650 or something I think on my laptop

### Transcriber-service of podcast audio to text
- Python script using ts-stable (a timestamp improved version of OpenAI's Whisper model)
- Uses Puppeteer to get the top 10 podcasts from certain countries
- Uses feedparser and podcastsindex.com's SQlite database for getting rss-feeds for further parsing
