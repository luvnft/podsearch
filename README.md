## Design timeline

## Realizations
- Don't optimize too early
- Too much caching is bad
- Don't debounce API calls as it worses UI and user-experience. Use rate-limiting instead or some kind of dynamic rate-limiting like google does (no debouncing on backend first 10 api calls, then rate-limiting)
- 

## Frontend:
- Nuxt 3 for client-stuff (with SSR for perfect SEO)
- [JSON to TypeScript type for types generation based on API response](https://transform.tools/json-to-typescript)
- Pinia for store
- TypeScript
- Pure TailwindCSS for UI adjustments and also the integrated PurgeCSS
- Bootstrap + Bootstrap Studio for responsive layout as it provides good UI for modifying design
- Cloudflare page for CI/CD of Client code + using them as a DNS-manager for easier setup.
- Tracking is done by [Plausible](https://plausible.io/)

## Backend:
### API:
- Route-Controller-Service structure for ExpressJS/Node-backends. [Rundown here](https://devtut.github.io/nodejs/route-controller-service-structure-for-expressjs.html#model-routes-controllers-services-code-structure)
- The backend is written in TypeScript
- Prisma Object Relational Mapper is used for database querying and modeling. Used with MySQL as database

### General NGINX reverse proxy setup
    server {
    listen 80;
    server_name api.poddley.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:7700/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
    
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.poddley.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.poddley.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
    }

### Full-text searching
- Rust based full-text search engine called Meilisearch is used to create fast full-text search of transcription data indexed from the MySQL database.
- Due to limitations on meilisearch and non-existant phrase-searching with typo-tolerance, custom solution was made.
  - Custom solution consisted of the following search-ranking score:
    - rankingRules: [
        "proximity",
        "typo",
        "words"
      ],
   - ...and the server search was done with 3-n-grams + jaccard string comparison finding the max score, sorting them based on similarityScore and selecting the top 5. This has proved to be a good solution.

### Transcriber-service of podcast audio to text
- The transcriber is a python script that grabs a selection of podcast names from a json.
- Queries a SqLite database downloaded daily from PodcastIndex.
- Uses feedparser to get episode-names, audiofiles, titles etc. from the rss-feeds for further parsing
- Uses the original whisper AI to transcribe data
- Then uses WhisperX to re-align the timestamps in accordance with the audio file (using the large [wav2vec](https://huggingface.co/jonatasgrosman/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-english) model.
- Then finds the youtube video that fits to that audio file and updates the episode in the database.
- Downloads the youtube video and finds the offset in seconds between the audio-podcast and video-podcast to save time and avoid having to re-transcribe audio from youtube video as well. This implementation uses [British Broadcasting Channel's](https://github.com/bbc/audio-offset-finder) own implementation. This value is then added or subtracted from the "start"-value that accompanies all segments.
- If a new podcast is added, express backend images endpoint uses sharp-package to resize image to webp-format and stores it in /uploads/ folder on digitalocean backend.

### Current running nginx reverse proxies for easier usage and https-setup:
  - images.poddley.com => .../api/images/ endpoints
  - api.poddley.com => .../api/ endpoints (transcriptions/search-functionality)
  - meilisearch.poddley.com => meilisearch GUI instance
  
### Other
- HTTPS everywhere done with let's encrypt /free https certificates

### Lighthouse score
![100](https://github.com/lukamo1996/poddley/assets/52632596/73235617-c7d0-4222-8b03-2a5fdbb604c6)

### Cron jobs
- Indexing from db to meilisearch-index (every hour)
- DeviationCalculator:
  - Positive means the youtube video needs reduction in the time
  - Negative means the youtube video needs the addition of time

### AI services
- All AI services run 24/7 on this machine=>![image](https://github.com/lukamo1996/poddley/assets/52632596/db542c41-922b-4057-ac3f-a7b23ede4a6a). I used to run and do tests on runpod.io due to their cheap prices, but realized quickly that long term use would quickly become expensive. Paperspace was even more expensive. Deepgram was ridiculous expensive.

- The AI models were initially running on my local computer running an RTX 1650, but it was crashing frequently and had insufficient GPU memory (would terminate sporadically). I also tried running an RTX3060 using ADT-Link connected to my Legion 5 AMD Lenovo gaming laption through the M.2 NVME as an eGPU. That was deeply unsuccessful due to frequent crashes. All solutions were unsatisfactory so splurged for a workstation in the end.

### Realizations:
- No amount of time optimizing backend will save you from long TTFB (Time To First Byte). After spending a week optimizing backend, testing out Vercel and Netlify (Pro and Free tier) trying to get speed-index below 2 seconds. Most was futile. Finally decided to try Cloudflare, went straight to 1.2 seconds.
- Unused CSS and third-party script/services can be a pain in the ass to deal with.
- CDN's are awesome
- Binary Search is awesome
- Lazy-loading is king.

### Optimizations:
- Assets compression:
  - Decided to use Brotli Compression to improve transfer time.
    *Since Brotli was designed to compress streams on the fly, it is faster at both compressing content on the server and decompressing it in the browser than in gzip. In some cases the overall front-end decompression is up to 64% faster than gzip.* [Source](https://eu.siteground.com/blog/brotli-vs-gzip-compression/#:~:text=Since%20Brotli%20was%20designed%20to,to%2064%25%20faster%20than%20gzip.)
  - Only using webp on website due to faster loading speed and better compression during transfer [Source](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/webp_study#:~:text=From%20the%20tables%20above%2C%20we%20can%20observe%20that%20WebP%20gives%20additional%2025%25%2D34%25%20compression%20gains%20compared%20to%20JPEG%20at%20equal%20or%20slightly%20better%20SSIM%20index.)

        Segment ID:
        The segment ID is essentially quite easy to implement. Simply have a copy button in the upper right corner of the segment and when a user clicks on it a link will be appended toeh copy value of the OS. This will point to a simply have search="id" just like normal search as it wouldnt really make any difference as the meilisearch wouldnt find any unique instance of it in the database if some transcription isnt directly referncing that segment, but athats' 0% probable.
        Getting segment time while audio is being played.
        The process for implementing this is to load the first 1 min segments from a given location and then grab the next 1 min segments everytime the time is 10 seconds from the last time of the gotten segments. If someone jumps more than 10 seoconds a 
        head or to a section for which we dont hjave the time like 1 hour ahead, then we just get the time on that spot and 1 min back and worth. However, we want to cache this to avoid re-fetchingsso how would we do that? We need to someone keep a track of the fetched segments and the once we still need to fetch, but this needs to be done elegantly, any ideas?
