        <h2 class="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Our Journey</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Our journey began with a shared fascination for the vast universe of podcasts. We realized that while there's an abundance of incredible content out there, finding that one specific snippet
          or moment you remember can often feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. This ignited our desire to create something that not only enhances podcast discovery but also makes those
          cherished podcast moments easily accessible.
